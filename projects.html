          <h2 id="p1">p1: Putting Text on the Web</h2>
          <p>Create a web page for a piece of writing. This writing could be yours, it could be written for this purpose, it could be written by you in the past. It could be someone else’s—found in a book, a zine, a manifesto, or elsewhere online. Make sure the text interests you and speaks to you, as we'll be working with it and designing based off of it over the first few classes. I'd recommend something long form, but not unwieldy.</p>
          <p>We’ll learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS through this exercise. First formatting it with basic HTML tags then we’ll move on to inline styles, then eventually reformatting it with a cascading style sheet.</p>
          <p>Throughout the assignment, we’ll draw on past skills with graphic design and typography and apply them to this new medium. However, this assignment is not focused on formalism or best practices. Experiment, try new things, take risks, and be expressive. The goal of this assignment is to experiment, we’ll use the knowledge gained more formally in later projects.</p>
          <p>Things we’ll consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What does it mean to publish text online (versus in print)?</li>
            <li>How does your page contextualize / recontextualize the writing?</li>
            <li>How can other elements enhance, change, or interfere with the text?</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="p1p1">p1p1: Find and Transcribe Text — DUE 4/10</h3>
          <p>Find a piece of writing that speaks to you and transcribe it in HTML using tags: headings, paragraphs, bold, italic, strong, emphasis, line breaks, lists, ordered lists etc. Upload this text as an HTML file to your DMA server space, and link to it from your Under Construction page.</p>
          <!--<h3 id="p1p2">p1 part2: CSS Styling Work in Progress — DUE 4/12</h3>
          <p>Add other elements, images, links, etc to your html document. Save an unformatted copy of it. Depending on how you style it, it may be good to have a back-up. Link a cascading style sheet and begin styling. Use classes to differentiate different elements.</p>
          <p>Try things out and experiment. Use different iterations and preserve them for us to look at next class. Have at least 3 header and body combinations. If you find it easier to iterate and experiment using inline or embedded styles, feel free.</p>
          <p>Upload your style sheet and updated html document, and link to the styled page on your homepage. We'll give feedback next </p>
          <h3 id="p1p3">p1 part3: Final Version — DUE 4/19</h3>
          <p>Your final text on a styled webpage. All styles should be implented through an external stylesheet. Use scaleable type best practices with rem units as well as correct typographic characters like typographer’s quotes and apostrophes (see: <a href="/resources.html#web-typography">web typography resources</a>). Implement a link back to top, and section links if the document needs them. Make sure the text is attributed and lists the original author. </p>
          <p>Upload the final file to your DMA server space and link to it from your homepage, as we'll be looking at the works live, online during crit.</p>
          <p>For crit we’ll be looking at the formal qualities of the page and how the styling fits your content. However, this crit and the grading for this project will be fairly low pressure, we’re looking for effort, improvement, and expermentation.</p>

          <p>A short, 5 minute, presentation on an artwork found on the <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/">Rhizome Net Art Anthology</a> that interests you. Presentations should include details on the context/time when the work was made, details on the artist(s) behind the work, and other works by those artists. Presentations my be a slide presentation with images or a series of links you take us through and explain. </p>
          <p>From week 4 on, we’ll start our class days with presentations by two students each day.</p>
          <p>Presentation dates have been assigned randomly. If you’d like to switch your date or know you’ll have a scheduling conflict, please ask a classmate to switch and edit the spreadsheet to reflect that change.</p>
          <h3>Presentation dates and picking work</h3>
          <p>Please pick the work you’d like to present promptly and list the title and the link in the schedule spread sheet. Please do not repeat a work that a classamte has already presented. This means that those going first have first choice of works.</p>

          <h3>A guide to the Net Art Anthology</h3>
          <p>Rhizome Divides its <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/">Net Art Anthology</a> into 5 Chapters Chronologically: </p>
          <h4>Chapter 1: “early network cultures and early web” [1984-1998]</h4>
          <p>Early works using the internet. Works often dealt with early internet forms. These include works like Jodi’s works we discussed in class one. Many of the questions and conflicts internet art still grapples with today originate here, such as net art’s relation to the art world; questions of curating, sharing, and selling work via the internet, the use of the internet as a means of communication and connection; and how those things can be subverted or intervened on.</p>
          <p>For more info See: Rachel Greene, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/print/200005/web-work-a-history-of-internet-art-465">Web Work: A History of Internet Art</a>
          </p>
          <h4>Chapter 2: The introduction of “flash and blogs” 1999-1995</h4>
          <p>In simultaneity with both the growth and further commercialization of the internet, net art of this era often dealt directly with these ideas, creating auction sites or tactical media interventions that aped corporate use of the internet. This era also corresponded with the introduction of flash and blogging.</p>
          <p>For more on the role of flash in internet art making see: Nathalie Lawhead, <a href="http://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/a-short-history-of-flash-the-forgotten-flash-website-movement-when-websites-were-the-new-emerging-artform">A short history of Flash &amp; the forgotten Flash Website movement</a>
          </p>
          <h4>Chapter 3: “surf clubs, early post-internet art, and social media platforms” 2006-2011</h4>
          <p>This era is characterized by artists responding to the growth of social media and siloing of the web. Both by using these new platforms in their work and creating their own platforms/communities, called Surf Clubs. This era is the beginning of what is called post internet, described by Gene Mchugh as, “‘internet’ became not a thing in the world to escape into, but rather the world one sought escape from...sigh...it became the place where business was conducted, and bills were paid. it became the place where people tracked you down.”</p>
          <p>For more on Surf Clubs see: Paul Slocum, <a href="https://sites.rhizome.org/surfclubs/">Catalog Of Internet Artist Clubs</a>
          </p>

          </p>
          <h4>Chapter 4: “mobile apps and social media saturation” 2012-Present</h4>
          <p>Now, when the postinternet condition has solidified. Characterized by the ubiquity of the internet, social media platforms, etc.</p>
          <h4>Chapter 5: Reprise</h4>
          <p class="whiteLine">Deals with other projects that don’t fit into these broader categories. A good example of this is Processing, started by Casey Reas and Ben Fry in 2001, but continuing and evolving until today.</p>
          
          
          <h2 id="p2">PROJECT 2: Responsive Portfolio Website</h2>
          <p>In this project you will be designing and developing an online portfolio website that represents you. You will research and determine a site concept, create a design based on this, and finally build it with HTML and CSS. How do you want others to see you and your work? What do you want them to notice first? What do you want them to take away?</p>
          <p>This project will focus on responsive design. Meaning that your site should work on both Phone and Desktop.</p>
          <p>For people who already have a website, you can make another or instead make a site for a single body of work; maybe you make games, posters, and do photography, so make a site just for your games or just for your posters. Consider how best to display these more specific works, how can the form and function of the site enhance these particular works?</p>
          <p>Projects will be graded on three categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>conceptual creativity</li>
            <li>aesthetic quality</li>
            <li>technical skill</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each of these three categories will be graded on a A(4) - F (0) scale. Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs. The final grade will be an average of these three scores.</p>
          <h3 id="p2p1">P2: Part 1: Content and References — [ <a href="/schedule.html#tuesday-1-31">DUE: 1/31</a> ] </h3>
          <p>Before you begin building anything, it is a good idea to first prepare a design document that outlines the goals of the site, the user experience, and the overall design. This document will guide you through the development process. We will begin by thinking about the content you want to include in your website, and examples of other websites you find inspiring. Please create a document that includes the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>References — Find at least four examples of artist or designer websites or portfolios that inspire you (you are looking for inspiring websites, not just websites of inspiring artists/designers). Include a screenshot, a sentence that tries to sum up their “design concept”, and a sentence about what you like about the site and why.</li>
            <li>Content — Choose at least four works that you would like to include in your website/portfolio. More is fine, but focus on quality over quantity. Include an image of each and note what kind of documentation you have (image, video, text, sound recording, etc).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This document does not need to be an HTML file, simply link to a google doc from your homepage or place a pdf on your server space and link to that.</p>
          <h3 id="p2p2">P2: Part 2: Design Concept and Sitemap — [ <a href="/schedule.html#thursday-2-02">DUE: 2/02</a> ] </h3>
          <p>Please add the following two pieces to your design document:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Concept (1-2 paragraphs) — Who is your target audience? What do you hope to convey about yourself and your work with this site? What will be the key elements and concepts behind the experience of your site? How will you leverage the medium of the web?</li>
            <li>Sitemap — A diagram of the pages of your site and the links between them.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 id="p2p3">P2: Part 3: Wireframes and Mockups — [ <a href="/schedule.html#tuesday-2-07">DUE: 2/07</a> ] </h3>
          <p>For Tuesday, we will be completing the design document with the final two parts – wireframes and mockups. Please print these, and/or host the files in an easily viewable way like an exported PDF hosted on your server. We’ll be viewing and discussing them in class.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Wireframes — Make diagrams showing the structure and functionality of the pages of your website. Include your homepage and one of each other page type.</li>
            <li>Mockups – Come up with two different, distinct design directions. Use Illustrator or a similar program to create a mockup for each, including at minimum, the homepage and one additional artwork page. Consider typography, iconography, color. Please remember that the website should be responsive and work on both phone and desktop, so your mockups should show views of each. A good size for a desktop mock-up is 1920px wide, with a line placed 1080 inches down to indicate where the content will likely begin scrolling. A good size for a phone mockup is about 400 px wide, with a line placed at 700 px down where scrolling starts.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 id="p2p4">P2: Part 4: Final Portfolio Website — [ <a href="/schedule.html#tuesday-2-21">DUE: 2/21</a> ] </h3>
          <p>The final part is to build the site you’ve designed with HTML and CSS. I would suggest doing this in steps, something like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create an HTML file for each page, and add the basic HTML structure.</li>
            <li>Finalize the navigation and make sure the pages link correctly between themselves.</li>
            <li>Add a stylesheet and define the basic layout of your pages.</li>
            <li>Populate the HTML with content.</li>
            <li>Further implement the design with CSS, tweaking HTML as necessary.</li>
            <li>Test with users, iterate as necessary.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The final version should have multiple pages and include at least four works. The navigation should be clear and the design should be engaging and coherent. Your site should communicate who you are and what you do to the audience that you outlined in the design document. It should look correct at both Phone and Desktop scale. One page for one piece should contain alt text for all the images with longer descriptions incorporated into the body text or linked outward as needed.</p>
          <p>You will have three minutes to present your site to the class, followed by a few minutes of feedback and critique. In your presentation you will want to make clear the concept, functionality, and structure of the site, as well as where you could see taking it further in the future.</p>
          <p class="whiteLine">Critique will be conducted in two groups listed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13834KH02UrMGljYYFnGLJSmSDMz5qRU1qNZWjsljdiE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please arrive on time. </p>
          <h2 id="p3">PROJECT 3: Fake or Speculative Website</h2>
          <p>Artists particularly in the early days of the internet art often used the web’s capacity for disseminating information for misdirection, forgery, and fakery. This was often done to make political or social commentary or sometimes just for humor. In recent years the internet as a tool disseminating misinformation or fake news has been an important conversation in our political discourse. Further, the internet’s capacity for anonymity often allows the creation of false identities, for liberating, creative, or sometimes nefarious ends.</p>
          <p>For this project you’ll be making a fake and/or speculative website. This could be fake, as in convincing imation or forgery, or speculative, creating something new that displays a possible vision of the future, attempts to be part of history, or manifests something you wish existed now.</p>
          <p>These sites might take many forms. For example, a personal web page for someone who doesn’t exist, a fake product page for a real or fake company, a forum—or archive of one—for a non-existent community. For the final iteration, you’ll make a single, integral page and its contents for this speculative website.</p>

          <h3 id="p3p1">P3: Part 1: Concept and Research — [ <a href="/schedule.html#thursday-2-23">DUE: 2/23</a> ] </h3>
          <p>Come up with your concept. What fake or speculative website are you trying to create and why? Think about what the concept of the website is and what content will appear on it. For example, a page for a fake band might contain tour dates, album covers, show posters, or song lyrics. Think also about who made the website, an organization, a person, a researcher or archivist? How might their voice, personality, or agenda affect the content. Think also about when the site was supposedly made, especially when finding other sites and images for inspiration.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Concept—write up a short, one page description of your idea. Give a background for the site, what you’re speaking to by making it, who speculatively or fictionally made it, and what content will appear on the site.</li>
            <li>Inspiration—find and take screenshots of three other websites to influence your work. Include a short commentary on each, what elements might you think about replicating or drawing from. Further find some examples of the kind of content you’ll want to include in the website. What this content is will differ by project. For example if you were making a website for a fake band, you might find scans of show flyers.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Link this document from your homepage as a Google Doc or as a hosted PDF.</p>
          <h3 id="p3p2">P3: Part 2: Mockup and Content — [ <a href="/schedule.html#tuesday-2-28">DUE: 2/28</a> ] </h3>
          <p>Create a Sitemap to brainstorm potential pages, then make mockups of the most important page on your site. Also begin making the kind of content that will appear. Along with the document from last week, this will function as the plan for your project. We’ll give feedback on your designs as well as on whether the approach seems feasible by the end of the class.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sitemap / Page list — Brainstorm what kind of pages might be included on your site. Look back to your inspirations and what kind of pages exist there, how are those sites structured?</li>
            <li>Mock-up — From your site map, decide on the single most important page to display your content and communicate the context. Sketch Two iterations of the design for that single page.</li>
            <li>Drafts of Content — Make some mock-ups of the kind of content you’re proposing to include. These should be examples, not just sketches. For example if you're making a band page, photoshop one whole album cover. Please try to stick to mediums you’re familiar with and can complete in time. You are allowed in this project to remix, collage, reuse found things, however you must consider fair use. Does your repurposing comment on or transform the original work? If you are using appropriated work, there should be a mix of your content and appropriated content. EX: if your page is a fake news article, you might use images (potentially with slight alterations) from elsewhere, but the article text would be all original writing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Please add these additions to your google doc from last week or re-upload your updated pdf at the same link address.</p>
          <h3 id="p3p3">P3: Part 3: Final Page — [ <a href="/schedule.html#thursday-3-16">DUE: 3/16</a> ] </h3>
          <p>Create a fully realized single webpage from your fake or speculative website using HTML and CSS. This web page should appear as part of a functioning website, for example that could mean including a functioning menu even if the links only lead back to the same page, or including a comments section with prebaked comments. As everyone’s site will be different both in terms of design and content, we’ll be considering your proposals and design documents to determine how effective the work was at meeting your goals and reaching a reasonable scope. </p>
          <p>In the lead up to the due date, we will be checking in with your work in class. Please make sure to be working on content and site design simultaneously, so that there is progress on both each class.</p>
          <p>The final project will be graded entirely on how effectively you realized your concept within the scope and time. For example, we will have different expectations of the final project of someone making a retro webpage with mostly appropriated amateur gifs, versus someone whose site involves making a detailed 3D model of a spaceship and many modern CSS effects. Consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How well does the design fit with the aesthetics you’re emulating or drawing from?</li>
            <li>Does the webpage effectively showcase the content?</li>
            <li>Is the content itself conceptually interesting, compelling, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Critique will be held in Groups as usual. See times <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13834KH02UrMGljYYFnGLJSmSDMz5qRU1qNZWjsljdiE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please Arrive on time. </p>-->
