Does data collection, by your institution, the state, or corporations change how you speak or act in the world?

The essay contains some Socialist-feminist and Marxist theory terms, like: reserve army of labor, reproduction of labor, and exploitation. If certain terms are unfamiliar, try looking them up or working through them together with a partner. At the start of our discussion we'll have time for questions, clarications, and discussion of terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Write:</b> A 1-2 paragraph reflection on your own experience and viewpoints as they relate to automation, the de-skilling of labor, and AI. How do you see automation and AI depicted today? Do you see liberatory potentials in these technologies, or is thier growth a source of dread, confusion, frustration, etc? How do these technologies and processes relate to your own work and field? If you have questions about terms, history, etc from the reading, please add them to the end of your response and we can discuss them in class.

            <b>Read:</b> The Data &amp; Society report, <a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DS_Deepfakes_Cheap_FakesFinal-1.pdf">Deepfakes and Cheapfakes: The Manipulation of Audiovisual Evidence</a>, by Britt Paris and Judith Donovan. The report is 50 pages but formatting, long footnotes, etc mean it is much shorter than it appears. If you feel you won’t be able to complete it in time, I’d ask that you read the <i>Executive Summary</i> (2-3) and either 1: <i>Introduction</i>, <i>The Cheapfakes and Deepfakes Spectrum</i>, and <i>The Politics of Evidence</i> (4-22) OR 2: <i>Cheapfakes on Social Media</i> and <i>Conclusion</i> (23-48). Reading option 1 will give a broader summary of the phenomenon of deepfakes and cheapfakes as well as a history of conflicts around audiovisual evidence and manipulation. Reading option 2 will give a wide array of contemporary examples of manipulated video evidence, and discussion of how to address these issues today. <br>(Content: Discusses the beating of Rodney King by LAPD officers, non-consensual deep fake pornography, and the 1991 Gulf War).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Write:</b> Your thoughts on synthetic media, misinformation, and manipulation today. Some possible questions: Has your trust in media online decreased over your lifetime? Was there a time where you were fooled by information you saw on the news, social media, etc? How do you determine what information is trustworthy today? About four years out from the writing of this report, what is your perspective on Deepfakes / Cheapfakes, do you believe the report was correct in viewing them as largely a continuation of previous misinformation practices or do you think that they pose a unique problem today? How do these issues around Deepfakes / Cheapfakes intersect with other issues we’ve discussed like, identity online and data-capture?

          <p>
            <b>Read:</b>Either Joana Moll’s <a href="https://researchvalues2018.wordpress.com/2018/01/03/joana-moll-deep-carbon/">Deep Carbon</a> or Miriam Posner’s <a href="https://logicmag.io/scale/see-no-evil/">See No Evil</a>. Deep Carbon deals with the physical infrastructure and environmental impact of the internet and Surveillance Capitalism. See No Evil deals with difficulties in seeing the impact of and unethical practices found in supply chains and logistics, and how logistics software contributes to that invisibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Look at:</b> Ingrid Burrington, <a href="http://seeingnetworks.in/">Seeing Networks</a> and Jenny Odell, <a href="https://www.jennyodell.com/wherewasitmade/index.html">Almost Everything I Used, Wore, Ate or Bought on Monday, April 1, 2013 (That Had a Label) Was Manufactured, to the Best of My Knowledge</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Write:</b> A reflection on the topics and ideas introduced in the reading of your choice. Both of the readings for this week do make arguments, but primarily present information. In responding to information, don’t just summarize. Pick out the things that interest or grab you and explain why. How do they relate to other things you’ve learned, studied, made work about, or experienced? Propose solutions to the problems they present. Further, both readings present information around the physical, ethical, material impact of technological infrastructure, is this new information to you? Or is this more common knowledge in your discipline / field? How have these problems been examined, addressed, or conceptualized in your experience?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Other questions for Deep Carbon:</b> Do you agree with Moll’s argument that smooth interfaces mask the realities of internet infrastructure’s impact? How do her assertions around the growing size of websites / digital files relate to your work, practice, or field? Could interfaces be used or changed to prevent alienation from the impact of digital infrastructure?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Other questions for See No Evil:</b> Do accept the moral framework that companies cannot know the impact of their supply chains, or that that opacity to some degree removes them from culpability? Do you have an ethic for your own consumption and use of goods, and do you think that’s a worthwhile endeavor? How do the softwares you use limit your own knowledge, creativity, or possibility spaces?
