        <h3 id="project3">PROJECT 3</h3>
         
        <p>This project is about crowds. What do you have to say to them? What can you learn from them? You will work in partners, and there are you will determine one topic or issue you want to address with a crowd. You will then determine one question or task to administer to a crowd – it could be via social media, mechanical turk, or some other online mechanism. Once you have collected your results, you will use them to create a compelling experience that meaningfully addresses the topic you chose.</p>

        <h4 id="p3p1">PART 1: TOPIC (DUE 11/21)</h4>
        <div id="p3p1-content" style='display:none;'>
          <p>Determine a topic or issue that your team would like to focus on for this project. It could be something in the news, an issue you feel needs more awareness, or anything else. The topic should be <b>specific</b>, and something you can form a <b>point of view</b> around. That is, "cats" or "the color red" are probably not appropriate topics.</p>

          <p>Once you have selected a topic or issue, create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">pecha kucha</a> presentation to share in class on 11/21. Your pecha kucha will have 10 slides for 20 seconds each, for a total of 200 seconds (about 3.5 mins). Please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kPZOSIIDldvVu-ok4idLgKoESYwxZieQ8aGhtl2B3nA/edit#slide=id.p">this template</a> which has auto-timed slides set up for you. See the instructions below for how to use it. In your presentation, you should introduce the topic, help us understand why we should care, and share your point of view on it. Both of you will present the pecha kucha together, so divide up who talks about which slide.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Go to File > Make a Copy</li>
            <li>Fill in the slide contents (you can delete the numbers).</li>
            <li>When it's done, go to File > Publish to the web, and select these settings and click Publish:
              <img src="../imgs/publish.png">
            </li>
            <li>Copy the link and test it in your browser. In the URL, add an extra 0 to the part that says 2000, so it reads "delayms=20000". This will make the slides advance every 20s.</li>
            <li>Add this updated URL to one of your class index pages for easy access during class.</li>
          </ol>

        </div>
        <br>
        <h4 id="p3p2">PART 2: CONCEPT (DUE 11/28)</h4>
        <div id="p3p2-content" style='display:none;'>
          <p>Think of a way to explore your topic with a crowd. Determine a question or task that will you will administer via social media, mechanical turk, or some other online mechanism. You will need to collect at least 50 responses. For example, you might ask each person to:</p>
           
          <ul>
            <li>Answer a question.</li>
            <li>Give you a piece of information.</li>
            <li>Give you a piece of media (image, sound, video, etc).</li>
            <li>React to a prompt or statement.</li>
            <li>Complete a task and send the results or documentation.</li>
            <li>Do a part of a task that is divided up over many people.</li>
            <li>?</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Here are some considerations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clarity – How will you communicate the question/task to people? How will you get them to respond?</li>
            <li>Scale – You will need to be able to collect at least 50 results. What channel will you use?</li>
            <li>Output – You will need to be able to display your results in some type of composition online, so consider the form responses will take.</li>
            <li>Privacy – If you require a very personal or identifiable response, let people know their response will be included in a project that may be publicly viewable online.</li>
            <li>Decency – How are you involving other people in your work? Are they able to consent? Are you treating them with respect?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <h4 id="p3p3">PART 3: COLLECT (DUE 11/30)</h4>
        <div id="p3p3-content" style='display:none;'>
          <p>Next, you will deploy your question/task through your selected channel online. You need to collect at least 50 results; you are welcome to collect more. Different channels will require a different strategy for connecting to people:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Social media – A Facebook post? An Instagram post? A Twitter poll? A Snapchat message? Something else? How do you ask and how do people submit their responses?</li>
            <li><a href="https://requester.mturk.com">Mechanical Turk</a> – Click "Get Started" and then "New Project". Choose the format that is most relevant. You may need to experiment with payment amount.</li>
            <li>Online platforms – An online form? A comment on a YouTube video? An email survey? Interviewing participants in a virtual world? What are other interesting online platforms you might use?</li>
          </ul>
           
          <p>You need to have deployed your question/task to your crowd by 11/28. Ideally, you will already have some of the results to work with in class.</p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h4 id="p3p4">PART 4: BUILD (12/7)</h4>
        <div id="p3p4-content" style='display:block;'>
          <p>Create a compelling display of your results online. Consider the results as your source material, you are welcome to add content, editorialize, or augment this material in any way you like. The form is completely up to you. Here are some ideas:</p>
           
          <ul>
            <li>Create a web page using HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li>Create an interactive experience using p5.js.</li>
            <li>Send it out piece by piece as a TinyLetter.</li>
            <li>Create an online identity that is the representation of all the collective voices.</li>
            <li>?</li>
          </ul>
           
          <p>You will present this in class on 12/7.</p>

        <h3 id="project2">PROJECT 2</h3>

        <p>
          Your goal with this project is to create a <b>mobile</b> artwork that <b>changes your experience</b> of a <b>specific location</b>.
          <br><br>
          Specific location – This could be on campus, in Los Angeles, or anywhere in the world. It must be a place corresponding to latitude and longitude coordinates. What is the significance of this place you have chosen?
          <br><br>
          Changes your experience – How does it change your experience of the place? Does it alter, augment, obscure, disorient, enhance, recontextualize...? To what end / why?
          <br><br>
          Mobile – Why is this a mobile experience? What does the use of mobile allow you to do? You must make use of a specific mobile functionality (GPS, accelerometor, touch interaction, camera, or something else approved by Lauren). I recommend focusing on one.
        </p>

        <h4 id="p2p1">PART 1: CONCEPT (DUE 11/2)</h4><br>
        <div id="p2p1-content" style='display:none;'>
          <ol>
            <li>Take a walk, drive, journey and identify your place. This <a href="https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/full/HJOquTwgZ">LocateMe app</a> <a href="https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/lmccart/sketches/HJOquTwgZ">(code view)</a> can help you identify your current lat/lon, or you can look up a location's position on google maps.</li>
            <li>Determine how your piece will change your experience of this place. Download this <a href="location-template.pdf">project template</a>, and write a one paragraph (minimum 4 sentences) description of the concept, identifying the mobile functionality you will make use of.</li>
            <li>Create a mockup design for each different state or your piece.</li>
            <li>Bring a printed copy of the completed template to class on 11/2.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
        </div>

        <h4 id="p2p2">PART 2: BUILD (DUE 11/16)</h4><br>
        <div id="p2p2-content" style='display:block;'>

          <p>The final piece should have a clear concept that is communicated through a fully resolved and implemented design. It should look correct on a standard mobile device size. For the review, you will demonstrate your project in class so if it only works in one GPS location, create a way for us to view it in class. Post a link to your project on your index page. Your project can either be uploaded directly to cyberduck, or you can post a link to the project in the web editor.</p>
    
          <p>Each of these three categories will be graded on a A(4) - F (0) scale. Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs. The final grade will be an average of these three scores. </p>

          <ul>
            <li>conceptually creativity</li>
            <li>aesthetic quality</li>
            <li>technical skill</li>

        <h3 id="project1">PROJECT 1</h3>
        <p>In this project you will be designing and developing an online portfolio or website that represents you. You will research and determine a site concept, create a design based on this, and finally built it with HTML and CSS. How do you want others to see you and your work? What do you want them to notice first? What do you want them to takeaway?</p>

        <p>Each of these three categories will be graded on a A(4) - F (0) scale. Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs. The final grade will be an average of these three scores. </p>

        <br>
        
        <h4 id="p1p1">PART 1: CONTENT AND REFERENCES (DUE 10/5)</h4><br>
        <div id="p1p1-content" style='display:none'>

          <p>Before you begin building anything, it is a good idea to first prepare a design document that outlines the goals of the site, the user experience, and the overall design. This document will guide you through the development process. We will begin by thinking about the content you want to include in your website, and examples of other websites you find inspiring. Please create a document that includes the following. This can be a digital file, or you can print it out.</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">References – Find at least four examples of artist or designer websites or portfolios that inspire you (you are looking for inspiring websites, not just websites of inspiring artists/designers). Include a screenshot, a sentence that tries to sum up their "design concept", and a sentence about what you like about the site and why.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Content – Choose at least four works that you would like to include in your website/portfolio. More is fine, but focus on quality over quantity. Include an image of each and note what kind of documentation you have (image, video, text, sound recording, etc).</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h4 id="p1p2">PART 2: DESIGN CONCEPT AND SITEMAP (DUE 10/10)</h4><br>
        <div id="p1p2-content" style='display:none'>
          
          <p>Please add the following two pieces to your design document. This can be a digital file, or you can print it out.</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Concept (1-2 paragraphs) – Who is your target audience? What do you hope to convey about yourself and your work with this site? What will be the key elements and concepts behind the experience of your site? How will you leverage the medium of the web?</li>
            <li>Sitemap – A diagram of the pages of your site and the links between them.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
        </div>

        <h4 id="p1p3">PART 3: WIREFRAMES AND MOCKUPS (DUE 10/12)</h4><br>
        <div id="p1p3-content" style='display:none'>
          For Thursday, we will be completing the design document with the final two parts – wireframes and mockups. Please bring hard copies to class, be prepared to discuss.
          <ol>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em;">Wireframes – Make diagrams showing the structure and functionality of the pages of your website. Include your homepage and one of each other page <b>type</b>.</li>
            <li>Mockups – Come up with two different, distinct design directions. Use Illustrator or a similar program to create a mockup for each, including at minimum, the homepage and one additional page. Consider typography, imagery, color.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
        </div>
        
        <h4 id="p1p4">PART 4: FINAL PORTFOLIO/WEBSITE (DUE 10/24)</h4>
        <div id="p1p4-content" style='display:none'>
          <p>The final part is to build the site you've design with HTML and CSS. I would suggest doing this in steps, something like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create an HTML file for each page, and add the basic HTML structure.</li>
            <li>Finalize the navigation and make sure the pages link correctly between themselves.</li>
            <li>Add a stylesheet and define the basic layout of your pages.</li>
            <li>Populate the HTML with content.</li>
            <li>Further implement the design with CSS, tweaking HTML as necessary.</li>
            <li>Test with users, iterate as necessary.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The final version should have multiple pages and include at least four works. The navigation should be clear and the design should be engaging and coherent. Your site should communicate who you are and what you do to the audience that you outlined in the design document. At minimum, it should look correct at standard laptop and desktop scales. You will have three minutes to present your site to the class, followed by a few minutes of feedback and critique. In your presentation you will want to make clear the concept, functionality, and structure of the site, as well as where you could see taking it further in the future.</p>
