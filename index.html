        <h2 id="description">Course Description</h2>
        <p>Network Media explores the creative, technical, and critical tools to realize Internet-based projects. The
          course is focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the Internet as a creative platform—where did it come
          from, how does it work, how do you make things for it, and what do you want to say? Technical workshops on
          HTML, CSS, and design support the development of a series of studio projects on internet based art making and
          exhibition. These projects are framed by seminar-style discussions examining the cultural, social, political,
          and philosophical implications of the Internet. We’ll consider the roles of race, gender, sexuality,
          disability, class, and influence within an increasingly networked world, and strategies of response as artists
          and designers. A key goal of the course is to examine and challenge the structuring power relationships,
          inequities, and biases embedded within network tools, technologies, and media.</p>
        <h2 id="expectations">Course Expectations</h2>
        <h3 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Examine the social and political implications of the Internet and related technologies, especially with
            its use as a medium for art and design.</li>
          <li>Discuss and articulate your viewpoints on these issues and ideas.</li>
          <li>Responding to these ideas through writing and making.</li>
          <li>Gaining experience with web design, web publishing, and HTML and CSS as mediums for art and design.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
        <p>Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project 1—20%</li>
          <li>Project 2—20%</li>
          <li>Project 3—20%</li>
          <li>Net Art Presentation—10%</li>
          <li>Weeklies—18%</li>
          <li>Participation, Discussion, and Critiques—12%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Project grades take into account conceptual, technical, and visual development as well as rigor and
          creativity. Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that
          does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs.</p>
        <h2 id="course-elements">Course Elements</h2>
        <h3 id="weeklies">Weeklies</h3>
        <p>Weeklies are our readings, and sometimes exercises for each week. Each week revolves around an important
          topic related to working with and using the internet in our present moment:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Under Construction</li>
          <li>How to Internet</li>
          <li>Identities online</li>
          <li>Interface</li>
          <li>Crowds and Gigs</li>
          <li>Data</li>
          <li>Synthetic Media</li>
          <li>Location and Decentralization</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each Weekly will be assigned Monday, and due Wednesday. For each one you are asked to open and check out all
          posted media; read, watch, or listen to at least one in full, and write a short two to four paragraph
          response.</p>
        <p>Responses are open ended, you could compare two readings, you could explain how the readings informed your
          work in this or another class, you could speak to how it relates to your daily use of the internet, or respond
          to, critique or reflect on the reading. Up to you. Also include in your response one discussion question
          related to the reading that we could consider in class.</p>
        <p>Create an HTML file containing your response, and link to it clearly from your index page. Weekly responses
          should be posted by class time Wednesday.</p>
        <h3 id="net-art-presentation">Net Art Presentation</h3>
        <p>A short, 5 minute, presentation on an artwork found in the <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/"
            target="_blank">Rhizome Net Art Anthology</a> or the <a href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/"
            target="_blank">Cyberfeminism Index</a> that interests you.
          Presentations should include details on the context/time when the work was made, details on the artist(s)
          behind the work, and present other works by those artists.
          You’ll sign-up for a presentation date and pick your artwork so we see a variety of works as a class.
          Once this presentation is assigned we’ll start our class days with presentations by two students each day
          throughout the remainder of the course.</p>
        <h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
        <p>We’ll have three larger projects throughout the quarter that address different uses of the web as an
          artist/designer/maker. Detailed Project info and schedule will be posted to the course website when the
          project is assigned.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Project 1 focuses on publishing text to the web. This project will serve to introduce HTML and CSS that
            we’ll be using throughout the course, and focus on translating skills of typography and graphic design to a
            new medium. Readings and discussions will focus on introducing the web as a medium, the ethics of design,
            and visions of what the internet is or should be.</li>
          <li>Project 2 will be creating a personal portfolio website. We’ll focus on the process of planning a web
            design project, and emphasize usability, accessibility, and responsive design. Readings and discussion will
            center around representing one’s self online and web interfaces.</li>
          <li>Project 3 will explore new web-based AI tools and synthetic media. We’ll focus heavily using the web as an
            artistic medium and conceptualizing and realizing web based artwork. Readings and discussions will focus on
            immediate issues of today’s internet, such as labor, surveillance, internet infrastructure, and
            information/misinformation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Projects are due by the beginning of class time on their respective due date. Projects may be turned in up to
          one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late
          will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline.
          Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, editor or browser errors, computer crash, etc.
          You should regularly backup your files on your desktop, online, and/or on an external harddrive or USB stick
          in case your computer is lost.</p>
        <h3 id="critique">Critiques</h3>
        <p>For critiques, the class will be split into smaller groups for more focused and close discussion of each
          student's work. These groups will be decided randomly before our first critique. You’ll only need to attend
          class for your group’s critique time on those critique days.</p>
        <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
        <p>Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts, ask
          questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques. Please do not use your phones or check
          messages, social media, etc during class time.</p>
        <p>This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking
          creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities.
          Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take
          responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let me or the TA
          know.</p>
        <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
        <p>Communication is key. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, email the TA before class. Absences
          will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances.</p>
        <p>You can use unexcused absence without it affecting your grade. Each unexcused absence after that will result
          in one full letter grade deduction. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the class.
          Illness requires a doctor’s note. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked late. Three lates
          results in one unexcused absence. Any questions about missed classes should be discussed with the TA within
          two weeks.</p>
        <h3 id="covid">COVID and Other Extenuating Circumstances</h3>
        <p>We understand that COVID, Flu, and many other circumstances could lead to prolonged absences and are
          committed to helping students keep up with the course when things arise. Please reach out promptly if a
          situation arises, and we can help make accommodations as needed.</p>
        <h2 id="commitment-to-diversity">Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h2>
        <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and
          cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the
          different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect
          self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our
          differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember
          that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and
          marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and
          discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive
          learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class
          member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
          instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another.
          Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are
          encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA. <br>

        <h2 id="land-acknowledgement">Land Acknowledgement</h2>
        <p>The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the
          Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and
          colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations.
          While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is a first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and
          indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Read more about
            what land you’re occupying.</a>

        <h2 id="disability-services">Disability Services</h2>
        <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience
          academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary for you to
          register with the <a href="http://www.cae.ucla.edu/">UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so that we can
          establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how to implement
          these accommodations. </p>
